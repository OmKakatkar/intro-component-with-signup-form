## My process

### Built with
- HTML5
- Vanilla JS
- CSS Grid
### How I went for the implementation?
Initially I struggled a bit with the overall implementation and the form validation part. Then I started breaking the problem into parts which were easy to work with.
- First I made a rough sketch for parts and sections on a piece of paper.
- Then I built a basic HTML structure with the design with a Mobile First approach
- Extended the styles for Tablet and Desktop
- Added styling for error handler
- Finally, did the form validations as per the requirements

It took some time, but learnt a lot.
